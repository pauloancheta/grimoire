# Grimoire

A personal collection of spells and learnings.

## Scripts (Spell Casting)
Instead of adding custom scripts to `/usr/bin`, it's better to add this repositories' `/bin` to your
`PATH`. Here's how to add it:

```zsh
# on your .zshconfig or .bashconfig
# assuming that this repository is in your `~` dir.
export PATH="$HOME/grimoire/bin:$PATH"
```
